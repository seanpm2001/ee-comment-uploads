## Overview

Comment Uploads allows you to give your users the option of uploading and attaching files or images to comments upon submission. Comment Uploads integrates very nicely into the native [EE Comments module](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/comment/overview.html) and has a good handful of variables for power and flexibility.
